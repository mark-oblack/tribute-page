			<p>Welcome, true believers! Growing up in the 90's, Spider-Man was my absolute favorite super hero. Since the days of Spider-Man: The Animated Series, the web-slinging hero has had multiple adaptations, from movies to comic books. This site will show you some of my favorite adaptaions of the wall-crawler and provide a few tidbits of information. Remember, with great power comes great responsibility...</p>

			<p class="amazing">The most well-known Spider-Man of them all, the Amazing Spider-Man is the foundation for which all other iterations were built upon. The man behind the mask, Peter Parker, was bitten by a radioactive spider during his high school years. Soon after, Peter himself gained powers similar to that of a spider, such as the ability to crawl on walls and a spider sense that alerted him to nearby danger. Peter also created his own mechanism to create webs like a spider that he uses commonly for travel and fighting off bad guys. However, Peter decided to not use his powers responsibly one night, which lead to the death of his Uncle Ben. From that point forward, Peter adopted the phrase "With Great Power comes Great Tesponsibility."</p>
			<p class="superior">One of the more recent iterations of Spider-Man, Superior Spider-Man put an interesting twist on the famous wall-crawler: Peter's mind was swapped with one of his greatest foes, Doctor Octopus. Prior to his death, Doc Ock swapped minds with Peter Parker and took over Peter's body and role as Spider-Man. However, Doc Ock was out to prove himself to be the Superior Spider-Man. This resulted in an upgraded suit for the wall crawler, which included homage to Doc Ock's famous tentacles.</p>
